# 50lbs of flare in a 10lb app! (ðŸ‘€)

Contacts Maxx takes the foundational structure from a typical Remix contacts app and elevates it to new heights. This vibrant, feature-rich application not only allows users to keep track of their contacts but also enriches daily life management through a multi-feature dashboard. Users can indulge in daily wisdom quotes, chuckle at dad jokes, organize their to-do list, explore weather patterns, dive into current news, and moreâ€”all within a visually stunning interface.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
- npm (comes installed with Node.js) or Yarn
- A browser to view the app

### Setup

1. **Generate the basic template:**

   ```sh
   npx create-remix@latest --template ryanflorence/remix-tutorial-template
   ```

   This uses a bare-bones template but includes our Chakra UI and data model, focusing on Remix. Check the [Remix Quick Start](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/basic) for a basic setup of a Remix project.

2. **Start the app:**

   ```sh
   # Navigate into your directory where you've unzipped the app
   cd path-to-your-app

   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Start the development server
   npm run dev
   ```

   You should now be able to open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and view your app locally.
